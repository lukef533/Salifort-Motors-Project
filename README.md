# Salifort Motors HR Data Analysis Project 

## Overview
This project, part of Activity Course 7 for Salifort Motors (November 2024), provides data-driven insights and predictions for the HR department at a consulting firm, aiming to enhance employee retention by identifying factors that contribute to turnover.
Project Description

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an employee leaving the company. By analyzing various HR data points, the project highlights influential factors that impact employee retention, potentially helping Salifort Motors refine their HR strategies.

### Key Deliverables:

Code Notebook: A complete notebook documenting data analysis, modeling, and evaluation, available for future reference and demonstration. Also include is a summary of the findings. 

### Dataset
The dataset includes 15,000 records with the following variables:
satisfaction_level: Employee-reported job satisfaction (0-1)
last_evaluation: Performance review score (0-1)
number_project: Number of projects assigned
average_monthly_hours: Average monthly work hours
tenure: Years with the company
work_accident: History of workplace accidents
left: Indicator if the employee left the company
promotion_last_5years: Promotion history in the last 5 years
department: Department the employee belongs to
salary: Salary level (categorized as low, medium, or high)

### Project Stages
The project follows the PACE framework:

Plan: Understanding the business problem and dataset, initial observations, and defining the modeling approach.

Analyze: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data visualization to identify significant factors for employee turnover.

Construct: Model selection and training, using a regression model or machine learning model (logistic regression and tree-based methods were explored).

Execute: Model evaluation and interpretation, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Key Insights and Recommendations
Employee Satisfaction: Low satisfaction levels significantly increase turnover.
Overwork: Employees with excessive hours or multiple projects have a higher likelihood of leaving.
Tenure and Promotion: Employees with longer tenure and recent promotions are more likely to stay.

### Recommendations:
Limit project assignments and cap working hours.
Regularly review and address satisfaction levels.
Promote deserving employees and clearly communicate policies on overtime and workload expectations.

### Ethical Considerations
This project emphasizes data privacy and fairness to ensure model use does not negatively impact specific employee groups.
